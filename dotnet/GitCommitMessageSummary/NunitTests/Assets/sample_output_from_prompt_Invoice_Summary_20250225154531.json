The issue was causing token validation failures under certain edge cases. Additional logging has been added to track future occurrences.\r\nFiles Changed: src/AuthMiddleware.cs, tests/AuthMiddlewareTests.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-11\r\nAuthor: Jane Smith\r\nCommit Message: Refactored database query logic to improve performance. The old query structure was causing slow response times on large datasets. Indexing strategies have been revised to optimize execution speed.\r\nFiles Changed: src/DatabaseService.cs, src/QueryOptimizer.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-12\r\nAuthor: John Doe\r\nCommit Message: Added new API endpoint for user preferences. Users can now store and retrieve custom settings for their dashboard. Validation has been implemented to prevent malformed requests.\r\nFiles Changed: src/controllers/UserPreferencesController.cs, src/models/UserPreferences.cs, tests/UserPreferencesTests.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-13\r\nAuthor: Jane Smith\r\nCommit Message: Fixed session timeout issues affecting user logins. The issue was related to incorrect token expiration calculations. A new mechanism ensures session persistence while respecting security policies.\r\nFiles Changed: src/SessionManager.cs, src/AuthService.cs, tests/SessionTests.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-14\r\nAuthor: John Doe\r\nCommit Message: Implemented role-based access control (RBAC) for admin features. This update restricts certain operations to authorized users only. The feature has been tested with multiple role types to ensure compliance.\r\nFiles Changed: src/security/RBACMiddleware.cs, src/models/Role.cs, tests/RBACTests.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-15\r\nAuthor: Jane Smith\r\nCommit Message: Refactored logging system to improve debugging capabilities. Logs are now categorized by severity levels for better readability. Additionally, new log filters have been introduced to isolate issues more effectively.\r\nFiles Changed: src/LoggingService.cs, src/LogFormatter.cs, tests/LoggingTests.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-16\r\nAuthor: John Doe\r\nCommit Message: Enhanced database schema for better scalability. Adjusted foreign key constraints and optimized indexing. These improvements will result in faster query execution and reduced load times.\r\nFiles Changed: migrations/2025_01_16_add_indexes.sql, src/models/DatabaseSchema.cs\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-17\r\nAuthor: Jane Smith\r\nCommit Message: Optimized front-end JavaScript bundle size. Removed unused dependencies and replaced larger libraries with lightweight alternatives. This has improved page load speeds significantly.\r\nFiles Changed: src/js/main.js, package.json, webpack.config.js\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-18\r\nAuthor: John Doe\r\nCommit Message: Updated API documentation for clarity. Added missing endpoint descriptions and improved request/response examples. The documentation is now fully in sync with the latest API changes.\r\nFiles Changed: docs/api/endpoints.md, docs/api/authentication.md\r\n-----\r\nDate: 2025-01-19\r\nAuthor: Jane Smith\r\nCommit Message: Improved error handling across all microservices. Standardized error codes and messages for consistency. This will make debugging easier and provide better insights into failures.\r\nFiles Changed: src/microservices/ErrorHandler.cs, tests/ErrorHandlerTests.cs\r\n-----\r\n",
